    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large yellow onion 1/4 cup olive oil </li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or more to taste </li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
<li><1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
<li></1/2 cup white basmati rice</li>
<li>1/2 cup pearled barley</li>
<li>1/2 cup French green lentils</li>
<li>8 cups water, plus more as needed</li>
<li>1 (about 15-ounce) can garbanzo or cannellini beans</li>
<li>2 ounces baby spinach (about 2 cups)</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh parsley</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
<li>Plain Greek yogurt, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <ol>
            <li>Peel and dice 1 large yellow onion. Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and a pinch of kosher salt and cook until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon ground coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric. Stir until the spices coat the onion, about 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>
                Add 1/2 cup basmati rice, 1/2 cup pearled barley, and 1/2 cup French lentils, and stir until well combined. Add 8 cups water and bring to simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and simmer until the grains and lentils are al dente, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, drain and rinse 1 can garbanzo or cannellini beans. Coarsely chop 2 ounces spinach until you have 2 cups. Coarsely chop the leaves from 1 bunch fresh parsley leaves until you have 1 cup. Coarsely chop 1 bunch cilantro leaves and tender stems until you have 1 cup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the beans, parsley, cilantro, and spinach to the rice mixture. Stir and bring back to a simmer. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pot, until grains are tender and cooked through and soup has thickened but is still a bit loose, about 15 minutes more. (Add more water if it gets too thick.) Taste and season with kosher salt as needed. Serve with a dollop of Greek yogurt and garnish with the reserved caramelized onions.
